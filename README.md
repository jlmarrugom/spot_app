# spot_app

This is an app that aims to make object detection fun! It is like a game, and you are like a tagger agent, or a Machine Learning model. The goal is to find the animal that it is requested before the counter expires. The counter was set to be super fast, so you have to be blazingly fast too!

The app uses a Clip model in the background, and a little set of images for the game, the more precise you are with the bounding box, the higher the chances would be to win the game.
